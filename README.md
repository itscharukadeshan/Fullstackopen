### What challenges I faced

  

- Change of the learning style

- This is the first time I had to understand every step of the development process.

- Understanding different between Node s vs Express

- Node Js is JavaScript framework and express is more abstraction of node to make the Node development to easy.

- In other words, *Node is a JavaScript Farmwork and express is Node _Farmwork_.*

  
  

- Using api data in react and handle the data inside of the apps

-
